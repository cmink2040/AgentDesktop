# VDesktop
VDesktop is a virtualized, proof-of-concept application designed for pure GUI raster-based AI interaction. This playground is made to avoid OS display automation complexity and breaking of personal devices.

While VDesktop is extremely simple, it will progressively get more and more complex till it represents a real application, in which case a real world OS implementation may be made.

## Usage
To run, setup Gemini API keys with ```cat "export GAPI_URL=yourAPIKEY" > .env```. Then install the reqs.txt. 

Run ```python -m adt.main```.
